<h3> Description:</h3> <br>
In this project i built an app that lets the user build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, they can also add a description for that place, can look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage for later.

To make all that work i used some previous skills such as forms, sheets, Codable, and URLSession ect. but i used two new framework named mapkit and corelocation. mapkit allows the view to integrate with the map and corelocation deals with the location of the user or device by generating longitude and latitude values. 

<br>

<h3>Frameworks: </h3>
   1. SwiftUI <br>
   2. MapKit <br>
   3. CoreLocation <br>
   
<br>
<h3> What I Learned:</h3> <br>
Here i learned how to work with CoreLocation framework and mapkit framework for find a location. I also learned how to find coordinates of that location .
<br>

<br> I also learned about-
1. Equitable and comparable protocol to compare two parameters.
2. How to find latitude and longitude with the help of CLLocationCoordinate2D.
3. Task modifier and await.
4. Find nearby places with coordinates.
5. How to save the names of the places in the doccuments directory of fileManager.
6. How to fetch saved data from fileManager.
